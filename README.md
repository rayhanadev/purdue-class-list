# Purdue Class List

This script parses the [Purdue Course Catalog](https://catalog.purdue.edu/mime/media/17/12496/2024-43-Courses.pdf) and generates a JSON file containing the course data for use in any application.

## Usage

Run the `start` command and it should generate a `courses.json` file in the same directory.

```sh
bun start
```
